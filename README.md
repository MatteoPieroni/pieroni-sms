# Pieroni sms

This repository contains the SMS function for Pieroni Intranet.

Using Node, we allow for the consumer to send an object containing a number and a message. We then send it to Skebby sms, which we use as out service provider.

This is the code for the `lambda function` hosted on Netlify.
